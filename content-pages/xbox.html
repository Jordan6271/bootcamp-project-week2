                <p class="row col-12">Xbox is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. The brand consists of four video game consoles, as well as applications (games), streaming services, an online service by the name of Xbox Live, and the development arm by the name of Xbox Game Studios. The brand was first introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the original Xbox console.</p>
                <p>Microsoft also have a system in place called Xbox Live, which allows users to play online multiplayer games with each other. It was first made available in November 2002, and has since been iterated on and improved. The Xbox Live service is available as both a free service, known as Xbox Live Free (formerly known as Xbox Live Silver) and a subscription-based service known as Xbox Live Gold, respectively, with most features such as online gaming restricted to the Gold service.</p>

                <h2>Xbox Series X / S</h2>
                <p class="row col-12">The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S were both released on November 10 2020. The Series X has better specs, and as such is more expensive; at $499.99 compared to the lower price of $299.99 for the Series S.</p>
                <img src="../images/xbox-series-x.png" width="100%" height="auto" max-height="720px" alt="Xbox Series X">
                <p>Microsoft has stated that Xbox Series X and Series S would support all games playable on Xbox One (excluding those that require the Kinect sensor), including Xbox 360 and original Xbox console games currently supported through backward compatibility on the Xbox One, thus allowing the console to support four generations of games. To achieve this level of compatibility, Microsoft announced they would no longer be bringing any additional Xbox 360 or original Xbox games into the Xbox One backward compatibility program in June 2019, and instead using their manpower to make sure these older games were playable on the Xbox Series X.</p>

As such, there are not many exclusive Xbox console-only games, but here are a few upcoming titles that will be on all Xbox Live platforms, but not planned to release on Playstation or the Nintendo Switch.</p>

                    <p class="col-12"><p>Xbox Series X stock shortages look set to continue throughout 2021, as Microsoft revealed that supply of its next-gen console will be limited until “at least through June”. Microsoft’s head of investor relations, Mike Spencer, revealed the sobering news in an interview with The New York Times, in which he also added that the company had sold every Xbox unit it had last quarter. Spencer’s comments line up with those of Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, who previously said that Xbox Series X stock will be “constrained” until at least March 31.</p>

                    <p>Another peice of bad news is that the promise of readily available Xbox Series X stock has been further hindered by chip shortages from AMD, who produce the Zen 2-based CPU and RDNA 2-based GPU in the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
